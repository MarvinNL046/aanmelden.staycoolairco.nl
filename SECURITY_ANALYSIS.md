# Security Analysis: PDF Storage and Access Implementation

## Executive Summary

The current implementation has **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES** that expose sensitive contract PDFs to unauthorized access. The PDFs are stored publicly with predictable URLs, allowing anyone to access them without authentication.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Found

### 1. **Predictable Contract IDs** (HIGH SEVERITY)
- **Location**: `components/Summary.tsx` line 80
- **Issue**: Contract IDs are generated using timestamp: `OC-${Date.now()}`
- **Risk**: Attackers can easily enumerate and access other contracts by guessing timestamps
- **Example**: If contract `OC-1704567890123` exists, attackers can try adjacent timestamps

### 2. **Public PDF Access** (CRITICAL SEVERITY)
- **Location**: `lib/pdf-storage.ts` lines 38-40, 68-70
- **Issue**: PDFs are stored with public URLs using `getPublicUrl()`
- **Risk**: Anyone with the URL can access sensitive contract information
- **No authentication or authorization checks are performed

### 3. **Overly Permissive Storage Policies** (HIGH SEVERITY)
- **Location**: `scripts/fix-storage-policies.sql`
- **Issue**: Storage policies allow anonymous users to read all PDFs in the contracts bucket
- **Policy**: `FOR SELECT TO anon, authenticated USING (bucket_id = 'contracts')`
- **Risk**: No row-level security based on user identity or contract ownership

### 4. **No Access Control Validation** (HIGH SEVERITY)
- **Issue**: No backend API to validate access rights before serving PDFs
- **Risk**: Direct Supabase storage URLs bypass any application-level security

### 5. **Sensitive Data Exposure** (HIGH SEVERITY)
- **Data exposed in PDFs**:
  - Full names, addresses, phone numbers
  - IBAN bank account numbers
  - Digital signatures
  - Contract terms and pricing

## Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Contract Enumeration Attack
1. Attacker notices contract ID format: `OC-1704567890123`
2. Writes script to try timestamps from past months
3. Discovers valid contract IDs by checking HTTP responses
4. Downloads all accessible contracts

### Scenario 2: Direct URL Access
1. Attacker intercepts or finds one contract URL
2. Modifies the contract ID in the URL path
3. Accesses other contracts without authentication

### Scenario 3: Data Harvesting
1. Attacker systematically downloads contracts
2. Extracts personal data, IBANs, and signatures
3. Uses data for identity theft or financial fraud

## Recommended Security Measures

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Generate Cryptographically Secure Contract IDs**
   ```typescript
   // Replace timestamp-based IDs with UUIDs
   const contractId = `OC-${crypto.randomUUID()}`
   ```

2. **Implement Signed URLs with Expiration**
   ```typescript
   // Use createSignedUrl instead of getPublicUrl
   const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
     .from('contracts')
     .createSignedUrl(fileName, 3600) // 1 hour expiration
   ```

3. **Update Storage Policies**
   ```sql
   -- Remove public read access
   DROP POLICY "Allow reads" ON storage.objects;
   
   -- Create authenticated-only policy
   CREATE POLICY "Authenticated reads only" ON storage.objects
   FOR SELECT TO authenticated
   USING (
     bucket_id = 'contracts' AND
     auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
   );
   ```

4. **Add Access Token Validation**
   - Generate unique access tokens for each contract view
   - Store tokens with expiration in database
   - Validate tokens before serving PDFs

5. **Implement API Gateway**
   - Create Next.js API routes to handle PDF access
   - Validate user permissions before serving files
   - Log all access attempts for audit trails

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Implement Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Link contracts to user accounts
   - Only allow users to access their own contracts

2. **Add Encryption at Rest**
   - Encrypt PDFs before storage
   - Decrypt only for authorized access

3. **Implement Access Audit Logging**
   - Log all PDF access attempts
   - Monitor for suspicious patterns

4. **Add Rate Limiting**
   - Limit PDF access attempts per IP
   - Prevent automated enumeration attacks

5. **Consider Document Watermarking**
   - Add unique watermarks to PDFs
   - Track document leaks

## Implementation Priority

1. **CRITICAL** (Do immediately):
   - Switch to UUID-based contract IDs
   - Implement signed URLs with expiration
   - Remove public access policies

2. **HIGH** (Within 24 hours):
   - Add API route for PDF access control
   - Implement basic access logging

3. **MEDIUM** (Within 1 week):
   - Full RLS implementation
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Rate limiting

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Security Testing**:
   - Attempt to access PDFs without proper authorization
   - Try to enumerate contract IDs
   - Test URL manipulation attacks

2. **Penetration Testing**:
   - Hire security professionals to test the implementation
   - Perform regular security audits

## Compliance Considerations

The current implementation likely violates:
- **GDPR**: Unauthorized access to personal data
- **PSD2**: Exposure of financial information (IBANs)
- **Local privacy laws**: Unprotected storage of sensitive data

## Conclusion

The current implementation poses significant security and compliance risks. Immediate action is required to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive customer data. The recommended changes should be implemented as soon as possible, starting with the critical items listed above.
